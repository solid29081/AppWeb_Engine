# AppWeb_Engine
## Welcome to AppWeb_Engine, here's what you will need to do
To get AppWeb_Engine working, its really simple. You need to change 2 lines of code that are so easy to understand.
Line 1 of code would be this:
url=f"file://{html_path}", (line 31)
and then.
title="AppWeb_Engine", (line 30)

Really fucking simple.

If you really want to, you can change the index.html in the assets folder to make the app using HTML

Skidded peice of shit.
